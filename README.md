> Utilizing the scrollbar as a width controler for the lightbox and images

###Guidelines
* The page that the lightbox lives on should be 2000px tall.
* On page load, the lightbox should start with an outer width of 800px.
* It should always be vertically and horizontally centered in the viewport.
* The six boxes at the top of the lightbox are images.
* As the user scrolls down the page, the width of the lightbox should shrink such that just as the user reaches the bottom of the page, the lightbox is one-third the width it is when the user is scrolled all the way to the top of the page.
* As the width of the lightbox shrinks, the images at the top of it should shrink proportionally as well.
